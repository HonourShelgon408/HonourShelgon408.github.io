PWA Scheduler V1

In my final year of my software engineering course, I have to complete a project. 
I have decided to creata a scheduling/not-taking app using similar projects as my inspiration, but building on their concepts
to meet my own set of demands for my own organisation. Examples include Google Keep, MSNotes, Padlet, Trello, OneNote, Google Sheets, etc
